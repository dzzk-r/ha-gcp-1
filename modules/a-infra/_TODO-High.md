## High-Level Security & Architecture Tasks

This document outlines the **strategic security and architecture tasks** required to ensure the project meets **national security-grade security** and best cloud practices.

### General Tasks
- [ ] **Enhance README.md** with detailed descriptions of all resources and dependencies.
- [ ] **Define IAM Policies** for **Project A (Network Security)**:
  - Ensure **least privilege access** for infrastructure components.
  - Document **access control policies and user lifecycle management**.
- [ ] **Clarify infrastructure scaling, monitoring, and logging strategy**:
  - Choose **Cloud Monitoring** for observability of networking & security services.
  - Define **alerting rules** for critical infrastructure failures.
- [ ] **Set up Terraform backend (Cloud Storage bucket) for state management**:
  - Enable **object versioning** for accidental deletion recovery.
  - Secure state storage with **encryption and IAM restrictions**.

### Network & Security
- [ ] **Finalize Cloud Armor security rules**:
  - Implement **DDoS protection and threat mitigation**.
  - Configure **logging & real-time monitoring**.
- [ ] **Validate Private Service Connect configuration**:
  - Ensure **secure, private connectivity between Project A & B**.
  - Evaluate **alternatives like VPC Peering or VPN**.
- [ ] **Review VPC Service Controls for data exfiltration prevention**.
- [ ] **Implement centralized security management using GCP Security Command Center**.
- [ ] **Enable network traffic monitoring with VPC Flow Logs & analysis**.

### Risk Management & Compliance
- [ ] **Perform risk & security assessments for the architecture**:
  - Identify **potential attack vectors & mitigations**.
- [ ] **Conduct penetration testing on the infrastructure**.
- [ ] **Develop a disaster recovery plan**:
  - Define **backup & restore procedures**.
  - Regularly **test recovery workflows**.
- [ ] **Ensure compliance with security regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.)**.
- [ ] **Train teams on security best practices & infrastructure management**.
