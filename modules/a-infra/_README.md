# Infra-A: Infrastructure Project A

## Overview
Infra-A is responsible for **networking, security, and global infrastructure policies** in this GCP environment. It ensures that applications and workloads deployed in DevOps-B operate securely and efficiently.

### Responsibilities
- **Networking (VPC, Subnets, Private Service Connect)**
- **Load Balancing (External and Internal)**
- **Security Policies (Cloud Armor, IAM, Firewall Rules)**
- **Global Infrastructure Compliance & Governance**

### Dir. Structure
```

  ├── load_balancer.tf         # External and Internal Load Balancers
  ├── cloud_armor.tf           # Security rules and traffic filtering
  ├── variables.tf             # Infra-specific variables
  ├── outputs.tf               # Terraform outputs
  ├── ToDo-high.md             # High-level infra tasks

```

## Next Steps
- Finalize IAM role restrictions for Infra-A.
- Validate Cloud Armor security policies.
- Ensure load balancing optimally distributes traffic between internal and external services.
