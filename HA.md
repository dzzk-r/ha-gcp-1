# High Availability (HA) & Verification

## Message for the Interviewer

**Hey Aviran,**

I've prepared three feature branches with tests for **Ingress + External LB**:

1. **feature/terraform-ingress-tests** – Automated checks for Ingress availability using `curl`.
2. **feature/terraform-iam-checks** – IAM permission validation to ensure Terraform has access to GCP resources.
3. **feature/terraform-outputs** – Useful Terraform output values for quick debugging of the Load Balancer.

I'm ready to discuss the implementation of each approach and how they can be applied. Below is an overview of the **High Availability (HA) verification strategy** and how Terraform helps to ensure a stable and scalable infrastructure.

## Task: Ensuring High Availability & Accessibility

The goal is to verify that the **GCP Load Balancer (LB) and Kubernetes Ingress** are correctly configured and working as expected. The solution must provide:

- **Automated tests** to confirm external access.
- **Debugging outputs** for quick troubleshooting.
- **IAM permission validation** to prevent deployment failures due to access issues.

---

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Automated Terraform Tests for Ingress Availability

Terraform doesn’t natively support HTTP testing, so we use `null_resource + local-exec` to run `curl` inside Terraform.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "test_ingress" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOT
    echo "Checking Ingress..."
    INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get ingress flask-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    curl -f http://$INGRESS_IP || (echo "Ingress is NOT working!" && exit 1)
    echo "Ingress is accessible!"
    EOT
  }

  depends_on = [google_compute_global_forwarding_rule.external_lb]
}
```

**What this does:**
- Fetches the **Ingress external IP** from Kubernetes.
- Uses `curl` to test HTTP access.
- Fails `terraform apply` if the Ingress is unreachable.

---

### 2. Terraform Outputs for Quick Debugging

We add outputs to show **External LB IP and Ingress verification steps** after deployment.

```hcl
output "lb_external_ip" {
  description = "External IP of the Load Balancer"
  value       = google_compute_global_address.external_lb.address
}

output "ingress_status" {
  description = "Ingress accessibility test"
  value       = <<EOT
  Run the following command to verify:
  curl -i http://$(kubectl get ingress flask-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
  EOT
}
```

📌 **Benefits:**
- Shows **External LB IP** immediately after deployment.
- Provides a **predefined curl command** for verification.

---

### 3. IAM Permission Checks for GCP Load Balancer

If the Load Balancer **fails to deploy**, it could be due to **missing IAM permissions**. We add an extra check to validate Terraform’s access:

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "check_iam" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "gcloud compute forwarding-rules list || echo '❌ No permissions to access GCP Load Balancer!'"
  }
}
```

**Why this matters?**
- Ensures Terraform **has the required permissions** before applying changes.
- Prevents wasted debugging time due to IAM restrictions.

---

## Final Plan

1. **`terraform apply` execution:**
   - Deploys **Ingress + External LB**.
   - Shows **External IP and debugging commands**.
   - Runs **Ingress availability check via curl**.
   - Validates **IAM permissions** for the Load Balancer.

2. **Failure handling:**
   - **Ingress unreachable?** → Issue with Kubernetes deployment.
   - **LB not deployed?** → Missing IAM permissions in GCP.

---

## Conclusion

With these Terraform enhancements, we now have:
- **Automated validation** of Ingress and Load Balancer.
- **Predefined debugging commands** in Terraform outputs.
- **IAM permission checks** to prevent access issues.

This approach ensures **High Availability (HA) verification is fully automated**, making deployments smoother and debugging faster.
